## Project description
In this study, mice were fed a 19% fat (lard) diet over 12 weeks. Four different diets contained 10 % of a variable component consisting of a different fraction of whole grain wheat. In addition two groups were fed diets including components not based on wheat.

group   wheat fraction
WG      whole grain
WF      white flour
BR      bran
AL      aleurone
OA      oat bran
CE      cellulose (microcristalline)

Aim of the study was to analyse the effects of different wheat grain fractions on physiological parameters, microbiota and intestinal metabolites in the background of DIO (dietary induced obesity) mice.
Data on physiology and caecum micrbiota after 12 weeks were published in Graf et al. (2019) doi:10.3390/nu11102348

The experiment was split in two phases due to limited capacity of the animal facility. 
Each phase included half of the animals of each group.
Timeframe was Apr-Jun 2016 (Phase 1) and Sep-Nov 2016 (Phase 2)

DNA samples were prepared for sequencing at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology by Elisabeth Varareck, Silke-Mareike Marten and Kim Distel
16S rRNA region V1-V2 was amplified according to the protocol by Camarinha-Silva et al. (2014), doi:10.1111/1462-2920.12362

Sequencing was supervised and performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform at Max Rubner-Institute by Dominic Stoll, Melanie Huch, Lilia Wiest (Rudolf) and Luisa Martinez.
